### The Paradox of Suicidal Thinking

![](/images/suicide.jpg)

If you’ve never experienced suicidal thinking, the idea of wanting to end your life seems extreme. It is.

It’s extremely painful to wrestle with a brain screaming at you that you’re better off dead.

There is a devastating misconception that people considering suicide are visually identifiable. You don’t need to appear sad or distraught while experiencing suicidal thoughts.

Some move through life seeming perfectly fine. They may smile and laugh. They may be popular in school, earn degrees and get work promotions. They may have nice houses, great families and supportive friends.

They can have all of these things and also be dealing with obtrusive negative thoughts that are so painful to carry that it feels like the only way to stop their thoughts is to not be alive.

People who don’t understand what it’s like living with suicidal thoughts may think, “Is life really that bad?”

Yes. For some, life really is that bad. It’s unbearable.

They may think they’re supportive when they say things like, “You have so much going for you and so much to be thankful for! Try to focus on the positives.”

It’s not about that.

You can have positive things in your life and have gratitude for those things while also carrying thoughts that are trying to convince you that you want to die.

The voice in your head tells you that ending your life is the solution. Your mind is desperately trying to help you survive your own thoughts by offering you an escape.

We want to survive. But we also want our mental anguish to end.

If there was more understanding and curiosity around the suicidal thinking experience, perhaps more people would be open about their internal battle. Maybe they wouldn’t feel as though the heavy load is for them to carry alone.

Societal stigma and the status quo force us to mask our struggles. Societal judgment shepherds our brains to the thinking that killing ourselves is the way to go.

If we normalized the experience of suicidal thinking as a paradoxical phenomenon. If we had more casual conversations about this serious topic, it could save lives.

As someone who has dealt with suicidal thinking for over 30 years, I want you to know this extremely important and critical truth:

We. Do. Not. Want. To. Die.

It is important to recognize the difference between passive and active suicidal thoughts (or ideation).

With passive thoughts, you don’t have a plan to end your life.

With active suicidal ideation, you do have a plan to end your life.
