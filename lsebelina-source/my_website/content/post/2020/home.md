Where do you go when your home does not feels like home...?

They say the word "house" is different to the word "home" wherein the word house is about a building made for people or a family to live in, while the word home is about the family living in a house, a special place where you feel most comfortable and that belongs to you, or a place that full of love and caring family.

But what if this house is never feels like "home"?

While I was walking home, I saw our house from the distance and looked at it. Our house that stood and colorful on the small village in a middle of a city. It is the house where me and my family lives. While looking at it, I realized something. From the outside, it appeared welcoming with its blooming garden that is full of colorful flowers and well designed fences. In that house, there is our family that appeared picture-perfect on the outside.

The husband and wife that is a happy couple and their son, that was a cheerful and bright kid. They are looks like a happy family to everyone. However, behind those closed door is a different story unfolded. A feeling of unease washed over you. The air felt heavy and suffocating, the walls seemed to close in on you, and the once inviting atmosphere turned cold and unwelcoming.

This house feels suffocating, like a prison we can't escape, and which imprisoned us since we were young. The little son who used to exude happiness and brightness seemed to be losing his sparkle, his light dimming with each passing day. The once loving husband and wife, that once intertwined hearts and united couple, now find themselves drifting apart, their connection fading like a distant memory. And the family that seemed to be perfect is actually a lie.

The lovely house they thought was happy, turned out to be a sad home. A place where emotions are not given value, a place where complaints are forbidden and one must be content with what is there. A prison where everyone is expected to accept their circumstances without a question.

Sa amin sa bahay ako lagi yung walang boses when it come in decision making. Lagi nilang sinasabing "masyado ka pang bata para sa ganitong bagay", sa tuwing susubukan kong mag rant ng random things that stresses me on school, ang lagi naman nilang sagot "mabuti ka pa ayan lang iniisip mo".

Growing up, nasanay akong harapin lahat ng bagay ng mag-isa kasi I have no one to rely on. I learned to do my school works on my own, handle my problems on my own, and heal my wounds on my own. I learned to enjoy being alone, for me there is a solace in solitude that gives me comfort, and I realized I don't need any help from anyone to handle my problems. But just because I carry it so well, it doesn't mean it's not heavy.

Naalala ko dati tinanong ako ng kaibigan ko kung balak kong magka anak someday and without any hesitation I said "yes". Gusto kong magka anak kasi I promised to my younger self na someday ay ipaparanas ko kahit man lang sa magiging pamilya ko yung mga bagay na hinangad ko mula pagka bata. I promised that if magkaka pamilya man ako ay hindi ko ito igagaya sa pamilyang kinagisnan ko. I want to break this curse.

“I know that I have to do something...”

Reflecting on my past experiences, I recalled the emotional void and lack of validation that characterized my upbringing. It was a household where complaints were silenced, emotions were invalidated, and opinions were unheard. Despite the challenges I faced, I am determined to establish a future home for my children that would be filled with love, happiness and emotional openness.

I don't want my children to grow up with having a fear of what their parents will think about what they will become. A sanctuary where my kids are not pressured to conform to someone else's expectations. I hope my son can express his emotions openly and embrace his vulnerability without fear. I don't want my daughter forced her self to be independent because his father wants her to be. And I don't want my wife to cry alone and sleep with an heavy heart. I long for my family to find solace in sharing their sorrows and not bearing them alone. I dream of a world where my children will always feel safe and supported, knowing they can come and talk to me without hesitation.

Nakakalungkot man isipin na malabo nang mabago ang sitwasyon na kinalalagyan ko ngayon, pero sa kabilang banda alam kong ito na ang huli, and I am determined to break the cycle of negativity and turn my future family into a sanctuary of love. And most specially is I won't make them feel what I felt growing up alone.
