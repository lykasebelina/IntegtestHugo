Has the uncertainty of the world ever crossed your mind? What will happen in the future? I often ponder what the future holds and I always believe in the saying “It is what it is.”

People always advise us to have a proper plan for the future because it’s important, but I don’t even have a plan because one of the reasons is the uncertainty of our world. It makes us doubt how our future will unfold.

The uncertainty of the world makes me feel overwhelmed because I can’t find a reason to live. I keep thinking that there’s a better tomorrow, but even tomorrow doesn’t seem worth living at all.

The only reason I keep going is because I have the will to help everyone around me. I don’t want them to suffer because of this uncertainty we face.

I don’t have a dream, but I have the will to be the light for someone.

To anyone reading this, always remember that you have the strength to persevere in the midst of uncertainty.
