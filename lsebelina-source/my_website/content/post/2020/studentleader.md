### So many eyes are waiting for me to fail.

Student leaders, like all of us, are humans. Many people forget that.

We may have chosen to serve the students and the school, but it feels like being under their microscope means that a single wrong move might portray us as the bad guy. 

Among all the good we’ve done, they’ll remember the mistake we made.

The position we have may hold power, but the pressure we feel to meet both our own and other people’s expectations could really destroy the confidence we have built along the years.

It’s tiring to constantly try to be perfect but still be relatable and approachable. 

You could never be too loud or too quiet. You must have high grades, or else you’ll be called a dumb leader. You could never show what you achieved, but if you don’t know, they will not be informed of your contribution. You could never be too much of anything, but you could never be less of everything.

Some of us student leaders don’t love being in the public eye, but we still love to make positive change and contribute to society.

When the night comes, I can’t help but want to hide in the darkness, where I know I can be myself without being judged. 

I’m waiting for the day when I can prioritize my own needs and goals without fear of being watched, when I can be free of all of this and give myself a break without feeling guilty about it.
