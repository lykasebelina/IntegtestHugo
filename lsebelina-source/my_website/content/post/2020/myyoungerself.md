Younger me has so many dreams she wanted to achieve. I can clearly remember how her eyes shine when daydreaming.
 
I am sorry for many things I did not achieve for her because I fell short. Maybe I was a coward for not pursuing a course or a profession both of us wanted, but know that I choose practicality above all else. 
 
The self-doubt is also killing me. I don’t know if I can stay in that course for four years, more so finish it in four years. The fear of shifting because you weren’t able to meet the guidelines also scared me. But believe me, I chose the course close to what we wanted.
 
I just don’t want to push through something I was not confident of during those times because I don’t want our family to spend a fortune in college in case I mess up. I can’t afford to fail because we’re not financially stable.
 
Even though I did well in my chosen field, I still think of those “what ifs” from time to time when I am clouded with deep thoughts.
 
It is really true that it’s hard to let go of the things or dreams that once ignited our hearts.
 
Nevertheless, I am doing my best to give the life our family deserves and heal the inner child within me.
 
To my younger self, sorry for not achieving some of the dreams you wanted for me. Thank you for dreaming and doing so well in many things at such a young age.
 
You’ve done so much for me. You’re the reason why I am still standing firmly against all odds, striving to be better.
