There’s something soft and gentle about “hintayin/wait nalang kita” no? When you think about it, simple lang ‘to pero it shows na someone is waiting for you patiently. Na para bang “Gawin mo lang yung mga dapat mong gawin, nandito lang ako, hinihintay ka.” or “You do your thing, I’ll wait.”

When I was a kid, I was always pressured to mature faster. To do things faster because ika nga na “Time is gold.” Madalas, noong bata ako, kailangan kong bilisan mag-ayos dahil maiiwan ako.

Pero what if all I wanted was to slow down and have someone wait for me?

That’s why I appreciate people who wait for me. It heals me and my inner child.

In our generation, napakahirap na maghintay ang mga tao. Everyone’s rushing you to be better, to do good, to be the top. So please find someone or people who’s willing to wait for you. I assure you, it’ll heal you.
