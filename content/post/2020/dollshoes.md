## I’m learning to love the sound of my feet walking away from the things that aren’t meant for me.

Just last August, I got my first heartbreak — no, not from a boy whom I met while I sacrificed my whole summer in review school, but with a school which I thought would open its gate to let me in while I carry a bag full of my family’s hopes and dreams for me.

Indeed, the world did not end when I read my rejection letter but you know, a part of me died that day — I grieved for that kid, with an oh so innocent soul who wished nothing but to make her parents proud and make her family feel that their efforts were never wasted.

But what I learned in that experience was that perhaps, that hurtful journey wasn’t wrong. Maybe I was just meant to change directions.

I’ve always viewed starting over as a sign of failure, but now I see it as freedom. Freedom to walk without carrying burdens that were never mine to carry in the first place. Freedom to walk without needing to prove anything to anyone.

So this time, I’m choosing shoes that fit me — not just my feet but the person I am becoming. Shoes that feel right for me, not for the expectations others had of me.

Kaya kung maliit na ang doll shoes mo na gamit gamit mo pa nung elementarya, i-tapon mo na agad. Let them go — kasama ng lahat ng expectations na nakatali sa ‘yo. It’s time to slip into a new pair, one that fits the person you’ve become — more comfortable, more aligned with where you want to go. At bukod sa lahat, for a fresh start with no regrets, no u-turns and just the freedom to walk your own pace, your own way.

It’s okay to outgrow things, even the dreams we once held close. The beauty lies in knowing that there’s always a next step — and this time, I’m taking it for myself.
