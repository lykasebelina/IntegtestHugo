_Pagmamahal oras at haplos_

_Ng 'yong kamay ang aking hanap_

_Ika’y nagkulang at ngayo’y nangungulila_


Listening to "Leron" for the first time felt like hearing a song I didn’t know I needed but somehow always carried in my heart. 

The track gently pulls you into a space where love, longing, and the desire for closeness coexist, and as a woman who’s experienced the ups and downs of love, I can’t help but feel deeply connected to the emotions it evokes.

The beauty of "Leron" lies in its simplicity. 

It’s a song that doesn’t need elaborate declarations of love or grand gestures to convey its message. 

Instead, it speaks in a soft, almost unspoken language, capturing the tender moments when you find yourself quietly hoping for someone to stay, to notice you in a way that only they can. 

There’s a sense of yearning in the melody, a vulnerability that pulls you in.

As a woman, I’ve often found myself in situations where words didn’t come easily, where emotions swirled inside, waiting to be expressed.

"Leron" reflects that unvoiced longing—when all you want is to be seen, to be understood, even if it’s just through the simplest of gestures. 

The song reminds me of how love doesn’t always need to be loud or defined by dramatic moments. Sometimes, it’s in the quiet “I’m here” that makes all the difference.

As the song unfolds, it feels like a conversation between two people—one who longs for the other, yet both are caught in the tension of what’s yet to be said.

“Leron” isn’t just a song about unrequited love or waiting for someone; it’s about being in a space where love exists in its most raw and honest form.

It’s a melody that speaks directly to the heart, reminding us that sometimes, even in silence, love can be loud enough to be heard.
