People always say that the youngest are the spoiled one but no one talks about the burden of being the youngest.

How unfair life is sometimes…

Being the last child means you have to sacrifice a lot, right? You have to do all the obligations that your elder siblings cannot do and considering others before yourself.

Being the last child means you're the last card of the family, especially if you have elder siblings that is not that fortunate on their career paths.

I grew up in a family that is not that fortunate in life. Growing up, I always put in my mind to work hard and achieve a lot of medals as much as possible so that I can pay off my parents' sacrifices—things that my elder siblings weren't able to do when they were still in grade school. I am not saying that I am the best among the siblings; it's just that my siblings are not that interested in any academic achievements, so they don't strive to gain more. Being the youngest means you can't make the same mistake that your older siblings did.

"I am the last card, I have to work hard so my family will have a better life, even if it cost me."

I’m the pride and joy that my parents are hoping for. My parents' are working hard to provide for my needs in school; they even sent me to a private school since the course I am taking is not available in any public schools that are near our house. They don’t put any pressure on me, but I can’t afford to fail given all the effort they’ve put in just to support me.

I am beyond thankful for my parents' hard work to the point I want to gain more just to at least pay it off. Yes, I’m tired, but my parents are even more tired — and being the "spoiled one" is like I don’t have the right to complain.

"Wag mo na isipin yung problema natin sa pera, basta mag focus ka lang dyan sa pag aaral mo"

I feel guilt every time we're facing a financial crisis because I can't help since I'm still not of legal age to seek a part-time job back then. Even now that I'm already an adult, my parents are still not allowing me to seek a part-time job so that I can only focus on my academics. I understand why my parents don't want me to bother about our financial burden because they don't want me to feel bad about my expenses. That's why I can't fail my finals, and I can't even fail my semester because, for me, it's the only way to pay off my parents' sacrifices. Also, I can't definitely fail since we can't afford to pay the tuition fee just to retake it another semester. I don't blame my parents or anyone else for the pressures I'm battling right now; I am the only one to blame for this because I'm scared of failure.

"What if hindi ako maging successful? Pano naman magiging buhay ng pamilya ko?"

All my life, I've been battling countless responsibilities that I have to grow up fast since the youngest's responsibilities were waiting for me. I am tired, pressured, and drained, but I have to be strong even though I'm the broken one.

Hearing my parents say, "Wala tayong maasahan dyan sa mga kapatid mo, ikaw nalang talaga maasahan namin" made me even more afraid to fail. Every day I have to push myself beyond my limits, because for them, I am someone who’s going to fulfill my family’s dream.

I always consider the sake of others, but what about me…?
