[{"content":"-Written By Sol People always say that the youngest are the spoiled one but no one talks about the burden of being the youngest.\nHow unfair life is sometimes…\nBeing the last child means you have to sacrifice a lot, right? You have to do all the obligations that your elder siblings cannot do and considering others before yourself.\nBeing the last child means you’re the last card of the family, especially if you have elder siblings that is not that fortunate on their career paths.\nI grew up in a family that is not that fortunate in life. Growing up, I always put in my mind to work hard and achieve a lot of medals as much as possible so that I can pay off my parents’ sacrifices—things that my elder siblings weren’t able to do when they were still in grade school. I am not saying that I am the best among the siblings; it’s just that my siblings are not that interested in any academic achievements, so they don’t strive to gain more. Being the youngest means you can’t make the same mistake that your older siblings did.\n“I am the last card, I have to work hard so my family will have a better life, even if it cost me.”\nI’m the pride and joy that my parents are hoping for. My parents’ are working hard to provide for my needs in school; they even sent me to a private school since the course I am taking is not available in any public schools that are near our house. They don’t put any pressure on me, but I can’t afford to fail given all the effort they’ve put in just to support me.\nI am beyond thankful for my parents’ hard work to the point I want to gain more just to at least pay it off. Yes, I’m tired, but my parents are even more tired — and being the “spoiled one” is like I don’t have the right to complain.\n“Wag mo na isipin yung problema natin sa pera, basta mag focus ka lang dyan sa pag aaral mo”\nI feel guilt every time we’re facing a financial crisis because I can’t help since I’m still not of legal age to seek a part-time job back then. Even now that I’m already an adult, my parents are still not allowing me to seek a part-time job so that I can only focus on my academics. I understand why my parents don’t want me to bother about our financial burden because they don’t want me to feel bad about my expenses. That’s why I can’t fail my finals, and I can’t even fail my semester because, for me, it’s the only way to pay off my parents’ sacrifices. Also, I can’t definitely fail since we can’t afford to pay the tuition fee just to retake it another semester. I don’t blame my parents or anyone else for the pressures I’m battling right now; I am the only one to blame for this because I’m scared of failure.\n“What if hindi ako maging successful? Pano naman magiging buhay ng pamilya ko?”\nAll my life, I’ve been battling countless responsibilities that I have to grow up fast since the youngest’s responsibilities were waiting for me. I am tired, pressured, and drained, but I have to be strong even though I’m the broken one.\nHearing my parents say, “Wala tayong maasahan dyan sa mga kapatid mo, ikaw nalang talaga maasahan namin” made me even more afraid to fail. Every day I have to push myself beyond my limits, because for them, I am someone who’s going to fulfill my family’s dream.\nI always consider the sake of others, but what about me…?\n","description":"People always say that the youngest are the spoiled one but no one talks about the burden of being the youngest.","tags":["pressure","expectations"],"title":"The struggle of being the last card.","uri":"/post/2020/lastcard/"},{"content":"-Written By Tine Lim Pagmamahal oras at haplos\nNg ‘yong kamay ang aking hanap\nIka’y nagkulang at ngayo’y nangungulila\nListening to “Leron” for the first time felt like hearing a song I didn’t know I needed but somehow always carried in my heart.\nThe track gently pulls you into a space where love, longing, and the desire for closeness coexist, and as a woman who’s experienced the ups and downs of love, I can’t help but feel deeply connected to the emotions it evokes.\nThe beauty of “Leron” lies in its simplicity.\nIt’s a song that doesn’t need elaborate declarations of love or grand gestures to convey its message.\nInstead, it speaks in a soft, almost unspoken language, capturing the tender moments when you find yourself quietly hoping for someone to stay, to notice you in a way that only they can.\nThere’s a sense of yearning in the melody, a vulnerability that pulls you in.\nAs a woman, I’ve often found myself in situations where words didn’t come easily, where emotions swirled inside, waiting to be expressed.\n“Leron” reflects that unvoiced longing—when all you want is to be seen, to be understood, even if it’s just through the simplest of gestures.\nThe song reminds me of how love doesn’t always need to be loud or defined by dramatic moments. Sometimes, it’s in the quiet “I’m here” that makes all the difference.\nAs the song unfolds, it feels like a conversation between two people—one who longs for the other, yet both are caught in the tension of what’s yet to be said.\n“Leron” isn’t just a song about unrequited love or waiting for someone; it’s about being in a space where love exists in its most raw and honest form.\nIt’s a melody that speaks directly to the heart, reminding us that sometimes, even in silence, love can be loud enough to be heard.\n","description":"Sometimes, love is not in grand gestures but in the quiet moments of longing and hope.","tags":["love","longing","hope","relationship"],"title":"Leron: A Melody of Longing and Hope","uri":"/post/2020/leron/"},{"content":"-Written By Odawni The Paradox of Suicidal Thinking If you’ve never experienced suicidal thinking, the idea of wanting to end your life seems extreme. It is.\nIt’s extremely painful to wrestle with a brain screaming at you that you’re better off dead.\nThere is a devastating misconception that people considering suicide are visually identifiable. You don’t need to appear sad or distraught while experiencing suicidal thoughts.\nSome move through life seeming perfectly fine. They may smile and laugh. They may be popular in school, earn degrees and get work promotions. They may have nice houses, great families and supportive friends.\nThey can have all of these things and also be dealing with obtrusive negative thoughts that are so painful to carry that it feels like the only way to stop their thoughts is to not be alive.\nPeople who don’t understand what it’s like living with suicidal thoughts may think, “Is life really that bad?”\nYes. For some, life really is that bad. It’s unbearable.\nThey may think they’re supportive when they say things like, “You have so much going for you and so much to be thankful for! Try to focus on the positives.”\nIt’s not about that.\nYou can have positive things in your life and have gratitude for those things while also carrying thoughts that are trying to convince you that you want to die.\nThe voice in your head tells you that ending your life is the solution. Your mind is desperately trying to help you survive your own thoughts by offering you an escape.\nWe want to survive. But we also want our mental anguish to end.\nIf there was more understanding and curiosity around the suicidal thinking experience, perhaps more people would be open about their internal battle. Maybe they wouldn’t feel as though the heavy load is for them to carry alone.\nSocietal stigma and the status quo force us to mask our struggles. Societal judgment shepherds our brains to the thinking that killing ourselves is the way to go.\nIf we normalized the experience of suicidal thinking as a paradoxical phenomenon. If we had more casual conversations about this serious topic, it could save lives.\nAs someone who has dealt with suicidal thinking for over 30 years, I want you to know this extremely important and critical truth:\nWe. Do. Not. Want. To. Die.\nIt is important to recognize the difference between passive and active suicidal thoughts (or ideation).\nWith passive thoughts, you don’t have a plan to end your life.\nWith active suicidal ideation, you do have a plan to end your life.\n","description":"The Paradox of Suicidal Thinking","tags":["suicide","thoughts","pain","life"],"title":"Suicide is About Wanting to Live","uri":"/post/2020/suicide/"},{"content":"-Written By Sol Where do you go when your home does not feels like home…?\nThey say the word “house” is different to the word “home” wherein the word house is about a building made for people or a family to live in, while the word home is about the family living in a house, a special place where you feel most comfortable and that belongs to you, or a place that full of love and caring family.\nBut what if this house is never feels like “home”?\nWhile I was walking home, I saw our house from the distance and looked at it. Our house that stood and colorful on the small village in a middle of a city. It is the house where me and my family lives. While looking at it, I realized something. From the outside, it appeared welcoming with its blooming garden that is full of colorful flowers and well designed fences. In that house, there is our family that appeared picture-perfect on the outside.\nThe husband and wife that is a happy couple and their son, that was a cheerful and bright kid. They are looks like a happy family to everyone. However, behind those closed door is a different story unfolded. A feeling of unease washed over you. The air felt heavy and suffocating, the walls seemed to close in on you, and the once inviting atmosphere turned cold and unwelcoming.\nThis house feels suffocating, like a prison we can’t escape, and which imprisoned us since we were young. The little son who used to exude happiness and brightness seemed to be losing his sparkle, his light dimming with each passing day. The once loving husband and wife, that once intertwined hearts and united couple, now find themselves drifting apart, their connection fading like a distant memory. And the family that seemed to be perfect is actually a lie.\n“Everyone thinks that we’re perfect. Please don’t let them look through the curtains,”— Melanie Martinez\nThe lovely house they thought was happy, turned out to be a sad home. A place where emotions are not given value, a place where complaints are forbidden and one must be content with what is there. A prison where everyone is expected to accept their circumstances without a question.\nSa amin sa bahay ako lagi yung walang boses when it come in decision making. Lagi nilang sinasabing “masyado ka pang bata para sa ganitong bagay”, sa tuwing susubukan kong mag rant ng random things that stresses me on school, ang lagi naman nilang sagot “mabuti ka pa ayan lang iniisip mo”.\nGrowing up, nasanay akong harapin lahat ng bagay ng mag-isa kasi I have no one to rely on. I learned to do my school works on my own, handle my problems on my own, and heal my wounds on my own. I learned to enjoy being alone, for me there is a solace in solitude that gives me comfort, and I realized I don’t need any help from anyone to handle my problems. But just because I carry it so well, it doesn’t mean it’s not heavy.\nNaalala ko dati tinanong ako ng kaibigan ko kung balak kong magka anak someday and without any hesitation I said “yes”. Gusto kong magka anak kasi I promised to my younger self na someday ay ipaparanas ko kahit man lang sa magiging pamilya ko yung mga bagay na hinangad ko mula pagka bata. I promised that if magkaka pamilya man ako ay hindi ko ito igagaya sa pamilyang kinagisnan ko. I want to break this curse.\n“I know that I have to do something…”\nReflecting on my past experiences, I recalled the emotional void and lack of validation that characterized my upbringing. It was a household where complaints were silenced, emotions were invalidated, and opinions were unheard. Despite the challenges I faced, I am determined to establish a future home for my children that would be filled with love, happiness and emotional openness.\nI don’t want my children to grow up with having a fear of what their parents will think about what they will become. A sanctuary where my kids are not pressured to conform to someone else’s expectations. I hope my son can express his emotions openly and embrace his vulnerability without fear. I don’t want my daughter forced her self to be independent because his father wants her to be. And I don’t want my wife to cry alone and sleep with an heavy heart. I long for my family to find solace in sharing their sorrows and not bearing them alone. I dream of a world where my children will always feel safe and supported, knowing they can come and talk to me without hesitation.\nNakakalungkot man isipin na malabo nang mabago ang sitwasyon na kinalalagyan ko ngayon, pero sa kabilang banda alam kong ito na ang huli, and I am determined to break the cycle of negativity and turn my future family into a sanctuary of love. And most specially is I won’t make them feel what I felt growing up alone.\n","description":"Where do you go when your home does not feels like home...?","tags":["family","relationship","toxic"],"title":"this house never feels like “home”","uri":"/post/2020/home/"},{"content":"-Written By LifeInLetters There’s a unique kind of freedom in realizing that you don’t have to be loved or understood by everyone.

But here’s the truth: you were not made to be everyone’s favorite, and you don’t have to be.\nNot everyone will appreciate your quirks, your passions, or the way you express yourself — and that’s perfectly okay.

For I always wonder:\n“Am I living, or just passing time?”\n“Am I gentle, or the world is just too cruel?”\nWith quiet nights who’s meant to be savoured to replenish all the energy we’ve spent today, these are my loudest moments. There are uncanny scenarios where I go to bed with a heart encapsulated on its morning.\nI didn’t do anything productive today.\nI just kept still, while I waited for the sun to go down. I chose to be quiet rather than talk; my mind is buried in secret veiled gardens once again. Laughters rang in my ears vigorously, much contrary on the emotion I am suppressing. There are moments left unexplored with emotions fleeting under– Simply, I just existed.\nBut isn’t that something to be proud of?\nBecause amidst of how draining life can be, I still showed up. No matter how much I despise waking up on the morning, just to see the inhumane reality I was in, I still went out of bed.\nEven though I’m drenched with anxieties and fear, I still managed to appreciate the beauty of those skies.\nThey say living is all about your choice, and I applaud myself for choosing life.\nInstead of fearlessly aiming for the brink of an end, I must be afraid of an unlived life.\nSometimes it takes us a great courage to went out with a heavy heart. But I want to remind you that sometimes, it’s okay to show up fragile.\nDo it scared. Do it sad. Do it while having a series of questions and mental breakdowns.\nJust do it, just show up. And at the end of the day, you can find yourself moving from the place you’re meant to outgrew.\nLikewise, I hope you can find the torch to went out from this darkest path.\nYou don’t need to speak out loud to be heard. Sometimes, your silence speaks louder than your heart. I hope that someone will bravely stand still, together with your lapses.\nYou’re heard and seen, even in silence.\nFor I am willing to stand beside you.\nKumusta ka?\n","description":"You are heard even in your lapses...","tags":["poetry","selfimprovement"],"title":"My most quiet moments are the loudest ones.","uri":"/post/2020/quietmoments/"},{"content":"-Written By Bino Who am I ?! This is the most asked question in my life. Yet no clear answer has yet been found.\nAs a child, the answer to this question was simple. Say my name to the question of who. Aha ..! Simple and beautiful. In that answer, parents and siblings in adolescence. I thought to myself that the answer was too clear.\nWhen I started asking myself this question at a young age when I was beginning to recognize many things, I began to feel that the answer was becoming less clear. Who am I ?! If you ask me who I am. Anyone else. Still no answer to the question. Who am I?\nSeek, that is the way to find the answer. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you !! The investigation has begun.\nThere is no doubt where to start. From me. I began to search the bottom of my heart in the silence. From there the search went on to the printed books. Couldn’t figure it out from there. No suitable gurus could be found to answer this question.\nThe search continued, and the only sound in my heart was to go ahead. The answer is nowhere to be found. So I’m still looking around, and the answer to my question is hidden somewhere.\nI do not know, some questions take time to answer. The meaning of a single word question is getting bigger and bigger. Who am I ?! What is my identity ?! What are my missions ?! Can I know the light of the answers ?!\nThose who ask the same questions go up the steps of consciousness and seem to be enlightened and insane. What will I become at the end of this question? !! Buddha or mad !! Anyone should have a small smile left at the end. The smile of recognition.\nWho am I, let the question continue.\n","description":"Who am I ?!
